# Simple-Zoom
 “Simple Zoom” allows for developers to easily implement ScrollView zooming functionality to their desktop and/or mobile applications through the use of the scroll-wheel and/or pinch-to-zoom gestures.

• Use clamped/elastic zoom types when zooming.
• Define whether to transform the scale or size (width/height) should when zooming.
• Assign different zoom controls (buttons, sliders, zoom views etc.).
• Determine whether movement should be restricted when zooming.
• Allow users to double-tap to fully zoom in/out depending on the current zoom.
• Adjust the button/scroll-wheel increment and smoothing.
